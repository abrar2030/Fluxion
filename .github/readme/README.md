# GitHub Workflows Directory

## Overview

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows that automate various processes for the Fluxion project. These workflows help maintain code quality, run tests, and deploy the application across different environments.

## Directory Structure

- `workflows/`: Contains all GitHub Actions workflow definition files (`.yml` or `.yaml`)

## Workflows

The `.github/workflows` directory includes automated CI/CD pipelines that handle:

1. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and validation when code is pushed or pull requests are created
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Automated deployment to development, staging, and production environments
3. **Code Quality Checks**: Linting, formatting, and static analysis
4. **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning and dependency checks

## Usage

GitHub Actions workflows are automatically triggered based on events defined in each workflow file. Common triggers include:

- Push to specific branches (e.g., main, develop)
- Pull request creation or updates
- Scheduled runs (e.g., nightly builds)
- Manual triggers via GitHub UI

## Adding New Workflows

To add a new workflow:

1. Create a new YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory
2. Define the workflow name, triggers, jobs, and steps
3. Commit and push the file to the repository

## Best Practices

- Keep workflows focused on specific tasks
- Use reusable actions where possible
- Store sensitive information in GitHub Secrets
- Add appropriate timeouts to prevent long-running workflows
- Include proper error handling and notifications
