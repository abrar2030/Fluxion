# Infrastructure Directory

## Overview

The `infrastructure` directory contains all the deployment, orchestration, and infrastructure-as-code components for the Fluxion synthetic asset liquidity engine. This directory houses configuration files and scripts that enable reliable deployment and operation of the Fluxion platform across various environments.

## Directory Structure

- `ansible/`: Ansible playbooks and roles for server configuration and application deployment
- `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes manifests for container orchestration and scaling
- `terraform/`: Terraform modules for infrastructure provisioning
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for local development and testing
- `docker-compose.zk.yml`: Docker Compose configuration specific to zero-knowledge components

## Components

### Ansible

The `ansible` directory contains automation scripts for:
- Server provisioning and configuration
- Application deployment
- Security hardening
- Monitoring setup
- Maintenance tasks

These playbooks ensure consistent environment setup across development, staging, and production.

### Kubernetes

The `kubernetes` directory contains manifests and configurations for:
- Pod definitions and deployments
- Service configurations
- Ingress rules
- ConfigMaps and Secrets
- StatefulSets for databases
- Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

These resources enable scalable, resilient deployment of Fluxion services in containerized environments.

### Terraform

The `terraform` directory contains infrastructure-as-code modules for:
- Cloud provider resource provisioning (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Network configuration
- Security groups and IAM policies
- Database instances
- Load balancers and CDN setup

These modules allow for reproducible infrastructure deployment across multiple environments.

### Docker Compose

The repository includes two Docker Compose files:
- `docker-compose.yml`: Standard configuration for local development
- `docker-compose.zk.yml`: Configuration specific to zero-knowledge proof components

These files enable developers to quickly spin up local development environments that mirror production.

## Usage

### Local Development

To start a local development environment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

For zero-knowledge components:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.zk.yml up -d
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

To deploy to Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
```

### Infrastructure Provisioning

To provision cloud infrastructure:

```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Best Practices

- Always use version control for infrastructure changes
- Test changes in development before applying to production
- Use infrastructure validation tools
- Follow the principle of least privilege for security configurations
- Document all custom configurations
