## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abrar2030/Fluxion.git
cd Fluxion/code
```

2. Set up the backend environment:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Initialize the database:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

5. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Configuration

The platform uses environment variables for configuration. Key settings include:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: Application secret key
- `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL`: Ethereum RPC endpoint
- `KYC_API_KEY`: KYC service API key
- `COMPLIANCE_WEBHOOK_URL`: Compliance notification webhook

## API Documentation

### Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using JWT tokens. Obtain a token by calling the `/auth/login` endpoint with valid credentials.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}'
```
