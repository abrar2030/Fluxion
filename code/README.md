# Code Directory

## Overview

The `code` directory contains the core implementation of the Fluxion synthetic asset liquidity engine. This directory houses all the source code for the backend services, blockchain smart contracts, and machine learning models that power the Fluxion platform.

## Directory Structure

- `backend/`: Python-based backend services and API implementations
- `blockchain/`: Smart contracts and blockchain integration code
- `ml_models/`: Machine learning models for liquidity prediction and optimization
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the entire codebase

## Components

### Backend

The `backend` directory contains the server-side implementation of Fluxion's services, including:

- API endpoints for synthetic asset creation and management
- Order processing and matching engine
- User authentication and authorization
- Data processing and analytics services
- Integration with blockchain nodes and external services

Technologies used include Python, FastAPI, Celery, and gRPC for high-performance communication.

### Blockchain

The `blockchain` directory contains all smart contract code and blockchain integration components:

- Solidity smart contracts for synthetic asset creation and management
- Zero-knowledge proof integration for private transactions
- Cross-chain messaging and asset bridging
- Liquidity pool contracts and AMM implementation
- Testing and deployment scripts

Developed using Solidity 0.8.x and the Foundry development framework.

### ML Models

The `ml_models` directory contains machine learning models and algorithms for:

- Liquidity prediction and optimization
- Price forecasting for synthetic assets
- Volatility modeling and risk assessment
- Arbitrage opportunity detection
- Market making strategy optimization

Implemented using PyTorch, Prophet, and scikit-learn.

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up the blockchain development environment:
   ```bash
   cd blockchain
   forge install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables as specified in the project documentation

## Testing

Each component has its own testing framework:

- Backend: pytest for unit and integration tests
- Blockchain: Foundry for contract testing
- ML Models: pytest and specialized evaluation scripts

Run tests using the project's test scripts from the repository root:
```bash
./test_fluxion.sh
```
