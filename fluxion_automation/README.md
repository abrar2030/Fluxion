## Validation

All scripts have been validated for:
- Syntax correctness
- Documentation quality
- Basic functionality
- Cross-script compatibility

See the validation report in the `validation` directory for details.

## Customization

Each script uses configuration files that should be placed in specific directories:
- Deployment configs: `./infrastructure/deployment/configs/`
- Test configs: `./infrastructure/test/configs/`
- AI/ML configs: `./code/ai/configs/`
- Monitoring configs: `./infrastructure/monitoring/configs/`
