# Documentation Directory

## Overview

The `docs` directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Fluxion synthetic asset liquidity engine. This directory serves as the central knowledge base for developers, contributors, and users of the platform, providing detailed information about architecture, APIs, security, and more.

## Directory Structure

- `API_SPEC.md`: Detailed API specifications and endpoint documentation
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: System architecture overview and component interactions
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the Fluxion project
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Instructions for deploying Fluxion in various environments
- `LIQUIDITY_MODEL.md`: Documentation of the liquidity model and algorithms
- `SECURITY.md`: Security practices, audit information, and vulnerability reporting
- `images/`: Supporting images and diagrams for documentation
