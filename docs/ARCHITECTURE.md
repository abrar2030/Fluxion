# System Architecture

## Overview
Fluxion is built on a microservices architecture leveraging ZK-Rollups for scalability and AI for liquidity optimization. The system is composed of several key components that work together to provide a robust synthetic asset trading platform.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **React Application**
  - Real-time trading interface
  - WebSocket-based market data streaming
  - Wallet integration via ethers.js
  - Interactive charting with Recharts
  - Responsive design for multiple devices

### 2. API Gateway
- **FastAPI Backend**
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - WebSocket server for real-time updates
  - Rate limiting and authentication
  - Request validation and sanitization
  - Load balancing and routing

### 3. Blockchain Layer
- **Smart Contracts (Polygon zkEVM)**
  - Synthetic asset minting and burning
  - Liquidity pool management
  - Order execution and settlement
  - Cross-chain message handling via CCIP
  - Governance and upgrade mechanisms

### 4. Liquidity Engine
- **Core Components**
  - Hybrid AMM implementation
  - Dynamic fee adjustment system
  - Liquidity provider incentives
  - Price impact calculations
  - Slippage protection

### 5. Risk Management System
- **Key Features**
  - Real-time risk monitoring
  - Value at Risk (VaR) calculations
  - Position limits enforcement
  - Collateral management
  - Liquidation triggers

### 6. AI/ML Pipeline

```

### Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling of API nodes
- Read replicas for databases
- Distributed caching
- GPU cluster for AI workloads
- ZK-Rollup for blockchain scalability

### Monitoring & DevOps
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- ELK stack for logging
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security
- Formal verification
- Multiple audit rounds
- Time-locked upgrades
- Emergency shutdown mechanism
- Bug bounty program

### Infrastructure Security
- Multi-factor authentication
- Network segmentation
- Regular security audits
- DDoS protection
- Key rotation policies

## Disaster Recovery
- Multi-region deployment
- Automated backups
- Failover procedures
- Data replication
- Business continuity planning

## Future Improvements
