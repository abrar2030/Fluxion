# Fluxion Project Setup Script (Comprehensive)

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
set -e

# Prerequisites (ensure these are installed and configured based on README.md):
# - Node.js (for frontend and blockchain components)
# - npm (Node package manager)
# - Python 3.x (the script will use python3.11 available in the environment for backend/ML)
# - pip (Python package installer)
# - Foundry (for blockchain development - `forge` command)
# - Docker & Docker Compose (for infra/services like zkEVM, TimescaleDB, Redis)
# - Celery (for backend task queue)
# - Access to Polygon zkEVM, Chainlink CCIP, The Graph (for full deployment)
# - Potentially other tools like Terraform, kubectl, graph-cli for full deployment cycle.
